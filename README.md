# Hogwarts sorting hat

Hogwarts sorting hat mobile application gives users the ability to guess the relationship between characters and Houses in a similar way to what Magic Hat did in Wizarding World.

## Getting Started

 -[The app consists of 3 screens: Home, List and Details.]
Display randomly selected personage on the Home screen (photo and full name of character).
Load different personage by pull-to-refresh gesture on the Home screen.
Allow to click the House buttons to guess the affiliation of this character.
On every choice, recalculate total/success/failed affiliations and display numbers in the boxes at the top of the Home and List screens.
The “Reset” button should flush all previously guessed personages and make all total values equal to zero.
On the List screen display previously guessed affiliations (successful and failed) and the amount of attempts for every character (until successfully guessed).
By clicking on the Reload button against the particular character, load this character on the Home screen with the House buttons again.
By clicking on the character item row on the List screen, open the Details screen. Display personage information only in case this personage has been guessed right.
